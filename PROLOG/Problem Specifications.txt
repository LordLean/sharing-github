The problem:
Consider the following problem, which is an adaptation of the famous Einstein / Zebra / Fish puzzle.
There are five identical houses lined up along a street.
Each house has a distinct colour and a single person living in it. 
Each of these persons has a distinct nationality, kind of pet, car, and favourite drink.

Now, one of the residents in that street has a cat named Brian, which wandered off a few days ago to have fun with his cat-friends.
He's now on his way back but there is a problem:

Unfortunately, Brian suffers from amnesia and so, cannot remember which house to return to. 
If he goes to the wrong house, he may get beaten up by the other animals (who all hate cats, esp. the canary).
If he doesn't make it back soon, he will starve. 
Can you help Brian?
